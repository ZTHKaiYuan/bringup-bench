Version 1.5
  - added support for hash-alone execution, which allows devices with no explicit I/O devices to be tested

Version 1.4
  - added RISC-V Spike instruction set simulator (ISS) support, which is 100% compatible with the "Simple_System" RTL target
  - 12 new benchmarks added, from AI, compression, audio processing, data processing, etc.
  - many improvements to libmin, including a much more complete math library

Version 1.3
  - added support for fine-grained library object files, resulting in an average code size reduction of 40%
  - added more benchmarks

Version 1.2
